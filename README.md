- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodeBreaker-E404
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new coding and programing languages. I particularly enjoy game development and testing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP, HTML, and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a Browser-Run Text-Based Fantasy MMORPG.
- 📫 How to reach me? That's a great question, I'd have to say the best way to reach me is via discord at CBSerror404#3539.
